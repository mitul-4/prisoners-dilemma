# Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation

In this simulation, there are 2 players: John & Jane. In a round of the game, each player can either cooperate (C), or defect (D). Whether or not a player cooperates or defects is determined randomly.

If both players cooperate, they each get 3 points.
If one cooperates while the other defects, the player that cooperates gets 5 points, while the player that defects gets 0 points.
If both players defect, they each get 1 point.

You can vary the number of rounds in each game.

Happy playing :)
